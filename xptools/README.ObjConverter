ObjConverter is a utility that converts 3-d models from various file formats  
to X-Plane object version 7 or 8 files. ÊAn X-Plane object file (.obj) contains 
geometry and texture information describing one 'object' for X-Plane scenery. 
An X-Plane object can be one building or many nearby buildings, contain only a
few polygons, or be a detailed model. ÊTypically you create an object in a 3-d
modeling program like AutoCad, 3D Studio Max, LightWave, SketchUp, ObjectMaker, 
etc., and then convert it to an X-Plane object version 7/8 file for use in 
scenery.

ObjConverter can also convert files to 3DS or DXF format. ÊThis can be useful 
in case you need to do additional editing, but converting the objects sometimes 
removes information from the object files.

WARNING: the OBJ format described here is X-Plane's OBJ format, which is 
totally different from the Alias/Wavefront OBJ format.  This program does not
work with WaveFront files!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ObjConverter requires OS X 10.2 (10.3 recommended) or Windows 98 SP2 or newer.
Generally it will run on any machine that can run X-Plane.

Simply decompress the .zip file; to use ObjConverter with XGrinder, make sure
that both applications are in the same folder!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USING OBJCONVERTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use ObjConverter with XGrinder, simply start XGrinder, then drag OBJ files
Into the XGrinder window.  

To use ObjConverter from the command-line, the syntax is:

./ObjConverter <flags> <conversion> <input file> <output file>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIMITATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conversions can be "lossy", meaning not all data can be converted from one
format to another.  In particular, OBJ7 files will lose OBJ8-only features and
OBJ8 files will lose OBJ7only features.  Try to do the minimum number of
conversions, and try to avoid round-trip conversions (e.g. 3DS to OBJ and 
back.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONVERSION FORMATS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ObjConverter can convert from the following formats:

	3DS, DXF, OBJ (versions 2, 7 and 8)

It can export to:

	OBJ versions 7 and 8, 3DS and DXF.

Here are some conversion limitations:

DXF: This format does not support textures or tex coordinate information.
3DS: This format does not support lines or lights.
OBJ7/8: These formats do not support multiple textures or hiearchial structure.

When a format does not support a feature, the information will be stripped.
So for example if you convert an object from OBJ7 to DXF you will lose your
texture coordinates and information.  If you convert from OBJ8 to 3DS you
will lose your lines.  If you convert from DXF to OBJ8 you will lose your
layers.

Generally you should avoid converting from OBJ to another format when possible.
Use OBJ as your final destination format for shipping, but use your modeler's
native format for editing.  (Think of this like using photoshop - when you
save as a PNG you lose your layers - if you edit the PNG you won't get them
back.  The same problem happens with modeler structures and groups when 
converting to OBJ.)

Usually 3DS is the best format to convert from for textured objects.

The command-line conversion flags are:

--obj23ds
--obj2dxf
--obj2obj
--3ds2obj
--dxf2obj

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONVERSION SETTINGS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Here is a list of the conversion settings from the menubar.  Please note that
the conversion options only apply to conversions from DXF, or 3DS; for
OBJ files the settings are always defaulted to the correct settings for OBJs.
 
Units:
 You may choose either inches, feet or meters for the conversion. ÊThis is the
 distance that 1 "unit" length in your source object will hold in the X-Plane
 world. ÊObjConverter cannot read any kind of unit hints from your source files.
 Usually a 3d program will always export a file with the same units. ÊThe 
 default is meters.

Command line: --inches, --meters, --feet

Center Object Horizontally:
 When this object is checked, the object will be moved horizontally so that an 
 approximate center of the object is used as the anchor point in X-Plane. Ê
 (The object will rotate around this point in WorldMaker too.) ÊUse this 
 option if your object appears far away from the placement point in WorldMaker.

Command line: --center

Flip X, Y or Z axis:
 ObjConverter can flip the orientation of any of the axes in the object. Ê
 However this may cause polygons to face in the wrong direction and become 
 invisible. ÊThis is provided as an advanced option only.

Command line: --flip_x, --flip_y, --flip_z

Polygons are Clockwise/Counterclockwise:
 This defines the orientation of a polygon's vertices when facing it from the 
 outside of the object. Êmost 3-d programs use counterclockwise polygons. Ê
 (X-Plane uses clockwise polygons; ObjConverter will swap as necessary.) Ê

Y Axis is up/Z axis is up:
 This defines which axis faces up in the model. ÊMost 3-d programs use the Z
 axis to indicate up. ÊHowever, others use the Y axis for up. ÊX-Plane always 
 uses the Y axis; ObjConverter will rotate your model as needed.

Command line: --axis_y, --axis_z

Saves as OBJ7
 This is ObjConverter's default setting and causes ObjConverter to save all 
 output as X-Plane 7 .obj files.

command line: --obj7

Saves as OBJ8
 This  causes ObjConverter to save all output as X-Plane 8 .obj files.

command line: --obj8
