ObjView is a 3-d viewer for X-Plane object files (version 2, 7 and 8). ÊX-Plane
has four major revisions of the ".obj" format, none of which are related to 
other public .obj formats (Alias Wavefront Objects):

 o 	Obj format 1 files were supported in X-Plane 5.0 and early versions of 
    X-Plane 6.0. ÊObj format 1 files use multiple bitmap files, with bitmaps 
    applied entirely to each primitive.  These objects are not supported by
    ObjView and are now very rare.
    
 o 	Obj format 2 files are supported in X-Plane version 6.0 and newer. ÊObj 
    format 2 files use one bitmap file, with parts of the bitmap applied to
    each  primitive.
    
 o	Obj format 7 files are supported in X-Plane version 7.0 and newer ÊObj 
    format 7 files are extensible, use one bitmap file per object, and contain 
    all features of format 2 files as well as new ones.
    
 o  Obj format 8 is suppoed in X-Plane 8.20 and newer  Obj 8 files allow for
    animation, smooth surfaces, and some other new capabilities.

Within each major type of object file, soem features were added to the format 
later; users of the latest version X-Plane 8 (8.20) or 7 should not have any 
problems with this. ÊObjView does not support original Obj version 1 files.

All object files are text files; you can open the file in WordPad to see its
version.  The version number is the second line and will be: 2 (version 2),
700 (version 7) or 800 (version 8).  A lack of version number indicates 
version one.

WARNING: the OBJ format described here is X-Plane's OBJ format, which is 
totally different from the Alias/Wavefront OBJ format.  This program does not
work with WaveFront files!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ObjView should run on any Mac OS X or Windows machine capable of running 
X-Plane.  If you cannot run X-Plane you may not be able to run ObjView.
Good OpenGL drivers (for OpenGL 1.2 or newer) are required.  For OS X 10.3 or
newer is recommended; for Windows, XP is recommended.

Simply decompress the .zip or .sit file; ObjView is totally stand-alone.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USING OBJVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use ObjView, simply double click the application and drag an .obj file into
the window to view it. ÊThe mouse wheel or +/- keys zoom in and out. ÊDrag the
mouse over the object with the left button moves it; with the right button
(or control + the left button) rotates it. ÊOn the Macintosh you can also open
additional ObjView windows by dragging .obj files onto the application icon in 
the dock. ÊThe mouse wheel zooms like the + and - keys.

Linux/Comand-line users: you can also open files by passing the file paths to
ObjView on the command line.

One note: ObjView zooms in and out around the mouse, so you must point to the
part of the object you want to see closer. ÊThis can take some getting used to, 
but once you work this way you will find it to be a rapid way to move around
the object, particularly if you have a scroll wheel mouse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIMITATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ObjView has some limitations in its viewing of objects:

- It does not display smoke puffs.
- Lights do not flash and the special lighting commands (99 99 99) etc. are
  not previewed.
- Lighting mode does not work for OBJ2/OBJ7 files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIEWING OBJECTS WITH TEXTURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To view textures in ObjView, drag a .bmp or .png file for the object's textures
into the window that you want to view the object with. ÊObjView does not pay
attention to the relative paths of the bitmap file and object file; simply drag
any properly named object and texture file into the same window to view the
object with textures.

If you drag a Panel.png file onto ObjView, it will be used to show the cockpit
panel texture part of your object.

Note: on the Macintosh, textures are shared between all open ObjView windows.
This allows you to view multiple objects with a common texture easily,
but you will not be able to view two objects with different textures of the
same name. ÊFor example, if a building from Boston uses the texture 
boston:wall.bmp and a building in Chicago uses the texture chicago:wall.bmp, 
you will not be able to view both objects at once because ObjView ignores the 
boston: or chicago: prefix and loads only the most recently specified wall.bmp 
image for both files.

KEYBOARD COMMANDS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All keys are case insensitive except where noted.

A   Toggle animation.

C   Toggle back-face culling.  Normally one-sided geometry is only one-sided
    but this option overrides it.

L   Toggle lighting (OBJ8 only)

M   Lower-case: measure the current object and display its X, Y and Z 
    dimensions in meters.

    Capitalized: toggle measure-on-open (starts off).  When on, any object that
    is oppened is immediately measured.  (Useful for finding the dimensions of
    a lot of objects.

N   Toggle night lighting.

F   Toggle whether the object is drawn solid or wire-frame.

=   Scale the size of the object up or down.  This is not the same as moving
-   the camera; it just makes the object bigger.

1-5 Show LODs 1-5 (OBJ version 8 only.)
