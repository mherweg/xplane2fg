					X-PLANE SCENERY TOOLS RELEASE NOTES


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENERY TOOLS FEBRURARY 12
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the second release of the combined X-Plane scenery tools.  This 
distribution combines the following tools into one package:

- DSFTool
- DDSTool
- ObjConverter
- ObjView
- XGrinder

This provides all command line tools as well as X-Grinder to automate use of 
them. MeshTool, WorldEditor, and plugins for 3-d editors are all shipped 
separately.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION, SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND LICENSING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scenery tools simply need to be unzipped somewhere on your hard drive.  In
order for XGrinder to provide a UI around the command-line tools, all of the 
tools need to stay in a subdirectory called "tools".

The scenery tools should work on any computer that can run X-Plane 864.

The scenery tools are open source; code original to Laminar Research is 
availble via the MIT/X11 license; various required libraries have licenses
that are compatible with either MIT/X11 or GPL.

The source code for these tools is all available at:
